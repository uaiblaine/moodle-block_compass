/**
 * The one place that knows a React component cannot import an AMD module.
 *
 * The import map Moodle serves has six keys and none of them is AMD: the prefix
 * `@moodle/lms/`, the design system, and react and react-dom with a subpath key each
 * (`lib/classes/output/requirements/import_map.php`, add_standard_imports).
 * A bare import of `core/ajax` from a .tsx is therefore a resolution failure
 * at runtime, and react_autoinit turns that into a console.error and a
 * component that never mounts - a blank region, not an error anyone sees.
 *
 * RequireJS is loaded on every Moodle page by a classic script, and every
 * React component is reached through a deferred module script, so the global
 * is always defined before a component runs. Core's own ESM reaches for page
 * globals the same way: lib/js/esm/src/profiler.ts reads window.M.cfg.jsrev.
