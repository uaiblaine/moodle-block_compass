/**
 * How many tracks tier 1's card grid gets, from the width the block has.
 *
 * The theme card's arithmetic (theme_boost_union_fundaseg, scss/category.scss): three tracks at
 * its widest, two below 1200 px, one below 576 px, with a 16 px gap. Compass measures the block,
 * not the viewport, because the block may sit in a drawer or a narrow column, so the thresholds
 * are restated as track widths: the narrowest track the theme ever draws is its two-track one at
 * the 576 px breakpoint, (576 - 2 x 16 page padding - 16 gap) / 2 = 264 px, and a count is chosen
 * when that many tracks of at least 264 px fit with their gaps - three from 824 px, two from
 * 544 px. accessibility_rules_test reads the two constants here and the gap in styles.css.
