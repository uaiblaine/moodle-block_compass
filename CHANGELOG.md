## Unreleased

### Added

- Phase 0 scaffold: block shell rendered through a templatable (no data access
  in the block class), `db/caches.php` with the three definitions of the two-layer
  cache (`coursemeta`, `inventory`, `details`), the query budget meter
  `classes/local/budget.php` with its tests, a null privacy provider, en and pt_br
  language packs, admin settings page carrying the cache-store notice, CI
  workflow (Moodle 5.02), mutation gates and coverage configuration.
- `docs/adr/000-scope-and-baseline.md`: the decisions the plan left open,
  settled with the maintainer before Phase 0.
